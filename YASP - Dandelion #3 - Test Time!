;    yasp - Dandelion #3 - TEST TIME
; 
; IF YASP RUNS SLOW SAVE ANY WORK YOU HAVE
; TO A LOCAL TEXT FILE (copy & paste) AND
; RE-OPEN A NEW YASP SESSION.
;
; Future training material will NOT have the
; above warning. It is now assumed knowledge 
; on handling the sometimes-clunky YASP.
;
; Welcome to the third lesson, and for the
; first time you'll be writing your own 
; assembly code!
;
; Here you'll use the concepts you've
; learned to write a program in YASP
; that demonstrates your understanding
; of handling printing and modifying text.
; =====================================
;       RECAP/ANSWERS TO LESSON #2
;
; The 'string' variable, covered at the bottom of the code in
; lesson 2, was stored in Read-only-memory. On the ROM tab, each
; 2-digit value was the hexadecimal representation of a given
; character (letter) or the start/ending bytes that indicate 
; information about the string, such as its format and length.
;
; Adding a number to the word register (that points to the string)
; is the equivalent of moving 'forward' X bytes of data, so when
; a character/number is changed in the word register it will alter
; a part of the string X characters past the 'start'. 
; =====================================
; 		INSTRUCTIONS
;
; Write a program that prints "Assembly", "Assembling" and "Assembled"
; to the debug console, each on a new line. 
; You MUST use only a single STRING variable.
;
; For ##BONUS## points, use the 'jmp' (jump) command to loop the program
; so that it prints these 3 lines over and over in order.
;
; For ##BONUSBONUSBONUS## points, use the 'cmp' (compare) command to
; have the program loop exactly 3 times, then exit. reading test11.mas in the
; sample YASP programs (available from their documentation on the main site)
; might help!
;
; When you've written your answer (either below this text, or in a new file),
; copy it to a text file and save it in the 'Dandelion #3 Solutions' folder
; with the following title:
